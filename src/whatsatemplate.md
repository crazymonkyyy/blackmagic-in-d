# whats a template anyway

//todo make allot more verbose and clear, and get beta readers who dont understand templates

In cooking theres a difference between a techique and a recipe. A "betty crocker yellow cake americain edition" reads differently from a a describtion of "stirfry". Likewise stovanov//todo spelling ranting about math is different from plain old c. 

//todo find video of rant

Where c is very close to thin layer over a finished program and is therefore like repeating a packaged cake recipe, templates are where steponv can put his ideas a techique.

You dont need to have betty crooker hold your hand to stirfry pork and leeks, it will be fine.

`template stirfry(alias Meat, Vegibles...)` and `stirfry!(pork,leek)`; you replace specail tokens to generate your recipe on the fly. Which is fine because `pork` and `beef` are culiarily very simuliar, handling the list of vegibles may take some getting used to, to say nothing of how to express seasoning. But all of that is possible.
